    <h3>GETTING STARTED: 2. Create your first project</h3>
    
    
    <!--- ___ PAGE CONTENT ___ -->
    In Part 2, you will create your first project, called a "sketch." Instead of starting from scratch, you'll learn how to import a project from another GitHub user. In the future, you may use this same process to import other peoples' creations into your own account so that you can "play around" with them. You will also learn how to make your new sketch into a website that you can use to test your code and share your creation with the world.<br>
    <br>
    The sketch that you will import contains only the basic ingredients to get up and running. It won't actually do much, but we will fix that in Part 3!<br>
    <br>
    OK. Let's get this going. If you aren't signed in to GitHub already, go to <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> and sign in.<br>
    <br>
    Navigate to your profile with the drop-down menu in the upper-right corner.<br>

    <br>
    <br>
    You'll see a screen that looks like this. Notice that you currently do not have any "repositories" yet. You'll learn what that means in just a moment.

    <br>
    <br>
    Let's get your first repository going. Click the "+" menu in the upper-right corner and select "Import repository".<br>
    <img src="images/gettingStarted2-03.png" border="1"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You'll be asked for "Your old repository's clone URL." Type or copy/paste the following text into that box:
    <p style="color:#0019bc;">https://github.com/marthClub/blankSketch</p>
    Then give your repository a name, like "myFirstRepository." When you've finished, click "Begin import".<br>
    <img src="images/gettingStarted2-04.png" border="1"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    GitHub will begin importing, which may take a few minutes. While you're waiting, read on to learn what a repository is.<br>
    <img src="images/gettingStarted2-05.png" border="1"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    While you're waiting...<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>What's going on?</b> You're creating a new repository on your account that is a copy of blankSketch repository on the marthClub GitHub. </li>
      <li><b>So, what's a repository?</b> A repository is a space on your GitHub where all of your files for a project are stored. Once the import is done, you'll be able to look at the code in your repository and edit it. That's mainly how we will use repositories at first, but there are a lot of other useful things that repositories can do.</li>
      <li><b>Oh yeah, like what?</b> For one, they track changes you make over time, allowing you to go back to previous versions if you mess something up.</li>
      <li><b>Yeah, that sounds useful. What else?</b> You can make a repository into a website that will run your creations on any device connected to the internet. That's one way for you to test the code you create as you write it. It also allows you to show off your work by sending or posting a link to it.</li>
      <li><b>Cool. Looks like this is done importing now. Let's do that website thing.</b> Excellent. That's what's up next.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    When your repository is done importing, return to your profile using the drop-down menu.

    <br>
    <br>
    You'll notice that you now have a repository! Click to open it.
    <img src="images/gettingStarted2-07.png" border="1"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    There's a lot going on here, but don't fret! We're only going to focus on a couple pieces right now. One of those is the "Code" tab, which is open now. It shows the files in your repository. Right now you'll see four files: README.md, index.html, p5.js, and sketch.js.
    <img src="images/gettingStarted2-08.png" border="1"><br>
    The other important piece is the "Settings" tab. Click on it now.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You're about to publish your repository to the web. In the "Settings" tab, croll down to the GitHub Pages section. Under "Scource", click the button that says "None", and select the "master branch". Then click "Save".
    <img src="images/gettingStarted2-09.png" border="1"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You've just put your repository on the web. If you scroll back down to the GitHub Pages section, you'll see the address for your website. Right click on the website (2-finger tap on Chromebooks), and open it in a new tab. SPOILER ALERT: It will be a boring blank white page.<br>

    <br>
    OK. That was anti-climactic. But hang in there. The good part is next!<br>
