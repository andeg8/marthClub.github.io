    <h3>GETTING STARTED: 1. Create a GitHub account</h3>
    
    
    <!--- ___ PAGE CONTENT ___ -->
    In Part 1, you will create a GitHub account. It will serve as a portfolio of your creations and also allow you to easily share what you make with others. GitHub is a site that professional programmers use to organize their files and work with each other. <br>
    <br>

    <b>A note about being responsibile internet user:</b> Take care when you choose your GitHub username. It is never a good idea to use your actual name for website usernames. GitHub is a public resource, and anybody will be able to see anything you do on it. Many people list their GitHub account on job and college applications because it gives a great snapshot of a person's abilities and growth in coding. You never know where this adventure will take you, so don't pick a username that will make you blush when it is brought up in an interview years from now... </font><br>

    NOTE: At some point you will be prompted with a message like this:<br>
    <img src="images/gettingStarted1-08.png" border="1"><br>
    GitHub is asking you to verify your e-mail. When this happens, just log in to you e-mail account, open the e-mail from GitHub, and click the link provided.
